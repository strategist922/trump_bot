I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan. Details to follow.,0
"If I win the Presidency, we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!",0
Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking?,0
Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!,0
On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.,0
Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.,0
Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide @QuinnipiacPoll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!!,0
Lyin' Crooked Hillary's email stories all have one thing in common. https://t.co/teoVCYXKOR,0
Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves? Think about it and let me know!,0
"The Republican platform is most 
pro-Israel of all time!",0
New GOP platform now includes language that supports the border wall. We will build the wall and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!,0

"To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals &amp; global special interests, we welcome you with open arms. People first.",0
Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.,0
Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.,0
"#CrookedHillary is not qualified!
https://t.co/6qi7KTW43O",0
I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out!,1
"Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!",1
"This election is a choice between law, order &amp; safety - or chaos, crime &amp; violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou",0
"For too many years, our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs, safety and protection for those in need.",0

"The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement, they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid!",1
President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!,1
Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton. We are a divided nation!,1

Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.,1

"Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement.",1
"Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team ""were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information."" Not fit!",1
Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!,1
"I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with ""murder."" Come November 8, she's out!",1
Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win,1

Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!,1
"On @FoxNews at 7:00 P.M. ""Special: Meet the Trumps"" Hope you enjoy!",1
Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?,1
"With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!",1
"Crooked Hillary Clinton is ""guilty as hell"" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails?",1

Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!,1
"The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!",1
"In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!",1
I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!,1
"The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting ""go away, no pictures.""",1
"Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about ""grandkids"" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?",1
"On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!",1
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged &amp; corrupt!,1
Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.,1
"Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it!",1
"It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged!",1
It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!,1
